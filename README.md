This repository contains the development of a collaborative thesis project for the completion of our Systems Engineering degree. Together with a dedicated team of fellow students and under the guidance of our school director, John William VÃ¡squez-Capacho, we are exploring cutting-edge approaches in [describe main topics, e.g., "energy efficiency in HPC systems" or "AI and V-net modeling for complex event diagnostics"]. Our work focuses on advancing methodologies that can offer both theoretical insights and practical applications in the field.

Through this project, we aim to contribute valuable research outcomes to the university and the larger academic community.
